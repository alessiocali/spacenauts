## What's this?

I first started working on Spacenauts as a self learning excercise while studying the libGDX framework. I wanted to make a somewhat retro space shooter that would fit well on mobile phones. The idea was to keep the controls as simple and immediate as possible, while providing some raw fun. Also, the retro style would make up for my somewhat lacking artistic skills.

## History of the project

The initial prototype only made use of basic features of libGDX. As it grew however, it became harder and harder to add things; so I abandoned it for a while. I rebuilt it from scratch later, on my way to graduating, using the ashley framework to keep things tidy. Later that year I committed the project under Git to safeguard myself from my own experiments, who almost risked me the whole multiplayer section. Eventually I became satisfied with what I did and published my work as a graduating project in Computer Engineering.

## What can you do with it?

For all I care, whatever pleases you. Study it, alter it, publish it, have fun fiddling with my work. Being credited would be much appreciated. I still have to decide a proper license, but it will probably one of the Apache licenses.

## What will I do next?

I had some plans to add new features, like Google Play support for leaderboards and achievements, a spaceship editor, an enemy compendium... and a proper continuation, since the game is rather short. As of now however I've put this on halt as I move onto other subjects (I'll start a Unity 2D project soon).

## Code analysis and feeback

Most of the code is self documented in English, with Javadocs comments. While I'm writing this I'm also setting up an open diary discussing on game development techniques, where you'll soon find my personal comments. Feedback would be MUCH appreciated: for all I could learn, I always feel like I know less than nothing and any hint is of help. You can read more here: http://g4f.altervista.org/tag/spacenauts/
